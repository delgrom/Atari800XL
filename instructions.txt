-------------------------------------------

Cores available for DE1,MIST,MCC216 and Replay
These cores differ a little in use.
These instructions were for the MCC216.

Brief notes for other cores:
Replay: Copy atari800.bin and replay.ini to the root. No drive emulation yet, use the serial port with sio2pc software. Roms loaded from ini file.
DE1: SW9: sdram only/sram then sdram, SD8: PAL/NTSC. Roms in atari800/rom and atari800/user. NB: RS232/GPIO SIO not connected yet
MIST: Roms in atari800/rom and atari800/user. New firmware (as of June 20th) needed.
MIST: Without keyboard its possible to use it! If you can remember these...
MIST: mist button0=F11, mist button0+fire=F12, mist button0+stick=reboot
MIST: mist button1=option, mist button1+fire=start, mist button1+stick=select
CHAMELEON: Roms in atari800/rom and atari800/user.
CHAMELEON: freeze button: toggle scanlines
CHAMELEON: CDTV remote: mouse:joy1,joy:joy2!,power:reboot,stop,reset,rew:start,play:select,ff:option,genlock:choose/boot(aka f11),cd/tv:settings(aka f12)
CHAMELEON: C64 keyboard matches Atari layout where possible:
CHAMELEON: (ESC)1234567890<>(CAPS)(HELP)(DELETE)
CHAMELEON: (CONTROL)QWERTYUIOP-=(TAB)
CHAMELEON: (BREAK)(SHIFT LOCK)ASDFGHJKL;+*(RETURN)
CHAMELEON: (INV)(SHIFT)ZXCVBNM,./(SHIFT)(F11/disk and boot)(F12/settings)
CHAMELEON: F1/F2=START,F3/F4=SELECT,F5/F6=OPTION,F7/F8=RESET(F9),CONTROL+F7/F8=COLD START(F10)
MCC216: As below... Official releases will lag but be better tested. This is a beta.

-------------------------------------------

The keyboard is mapped to match an Atari 800XL physical layout(See below).

Special/console keys:
F5  - Help
F6  - Start
F7  - Select
F8  - Option
F9  - Reset
F10 - Cold start (clear base 64KB RAM and reset) 
F11 - Select drive 1 and cold start
	Use joystick to make selection in menu
		Left - up several lines
		Right - down several lines
		Up - up 1 line
		Down - down 1 line
		Fire - select
	Remember many titles require holding 'option'
	Select "DIR .." to go up a directory
	Select "DIR xxx" to go down a directory
F12 - System settings menu
	Use joystick to make selection
	Turbo - system speed
		Left/right to select
		1x (default): is very compatible - speed closely matches original hardware ~1.7MHz
		2x: ~3.4MHz - less compatible
		4x: ~6.8MHz - less compatible
		8x/16x: 13MHz, 27MHZ - limited by SDRAM latency, not quicker than 4x yet.
	RAM
		Left/right to select
		64KB:  like 65XE
		128KB: like 130XE, 64KB ext ram, switchable by antic/cpu
		320KB(Compy shop)(default): 256KB ext ram, switchable by antic/cpu 
		320KB(Rambo): 256KB ext ram, both antic/cpu switch together
		576KB(Compy shop): 512KB ext ram, switchable by antic/cpu 
		576KB(Rambo): 512KB ext ram, both antic/cpu switch together
		1088KB: 1024KB ext ram, both antic/cpu switch together
		4160KB: - very imcompatible!
	ROM
		Right/fire: File selector
		Select a different system OS ROM - can by 16KB or 10KB
	Drive
		Left: Remove disk
		Right: File selector
		Fire: Put this disk in F1
	Cartridge 8K simple
		Fire: select file
		This allows a ROM to be loaded in the place of BASIC
		Some simple ROM cartridges can be used
		This is temporary until proper cartridge support is implemented

System ROM:
	Loaded from /System/rom/atari800/atarixl.rom

Basic:
	Loaded from /System/rom/atari800/ataribas.rom

Disk images:
	Default dir: /atari800/user
	Supported types: 
		.ATR - Atari disk image with header. single/medium/double density.
		.XFD - Atari disk image without header. 
		.XEX - Atari executable. A simple bootloader is loaded, not 100% compatible. 

Important notes:
	When running Atari software a lot of programs need to have basic disable. Hold option when pressing reset.

Keyboard layout

The keyboard is mapped to match an Atari 800XL physical layout.  On a UK keyboard this means the layout is:
	Directly mapped:
		ESCAPE,F1-F4,BREAK,CONTROL,SHIFT
	By position:
		1234567890<>(DELETE)
		(TAB)QWERTYUIOP-=(RETURN)
		(CAPS)ASDFGHJKL;+*
		ZXCVBNM,./
	Other:
		Right alt = inverse video


Features

* Acid 800 test pass
* 99% of software runs
* Version for PAL/NTSC VGA/SVIDEO
* Write support
* Drive emulation

Known issues

* ~1% of programs fail
* Keyboard layout board on UK PS2 keyboard, no remapping possible yet.
* Copymate write verify fails
* Entering menu during disk access may hang ZPU (used for drive emulation/menus)
* Sometimes keyboard input fails - need to power off/on the MCC.
* Hardware matches Atari very closely - including overscan corruption - this often shows up on VGA monitors.

Enjoy !
