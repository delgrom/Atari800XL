Version 1
---------
Initial source release

Version 2
---------
Initial release that runs on Replay
Disks can be loaded via SIO2PC (P1 jumper to FPGA, serial cable to PC, run aspeqt)
No internal floppy emulation in this release (i.e. no loading from SD card)
Running pretty well, but a few small things to fix - such as it seems to be impossible to press option in time to boot!
A lot of the DE1 code has been stripped from this version, but there is still considerable cruft...
For now memory config is fixed and ROM is built in.

Version 3
---------
Memory and rom selectable from replay menu
Improvements to video out
PAL/NTSC bits fixed
