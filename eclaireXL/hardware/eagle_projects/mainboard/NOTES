If making this note that it requires 5mil clearance and 10mil drills. Use Osh park 4 layer dru, though change it to make the 10mil drills have solder mask on them. So there are no bare copper in the bga footprint for the drills there.

NB: I've made these boards, but have not as yet tested/assembled them. So YMMV...
